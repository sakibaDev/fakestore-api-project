# Fakestore API Project

This is a basic e-commerce web project built using the [Fakestore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/). It was originally created as part of a learning platform(Phitron) to learn how to work with APIs and handle DOM manipulation in JavaScript.

## Features

- Fetches product data from Fakestore API
- Displays products with image, title, price, and category
- Responsive layout using HTML & CSS (or Bootstrap, if used)
- Basic JavaScript to handle data and render it to the DOM

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (or Bootstrap)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Fakestore API

## What I Learned

- How to use `fetch()` to call external APIs
- Parsing JSON responses
- Dynamically creating and appending elements with JavaScript
- Structuring simple frontend projects

## Future Improvements

- Implement search and filter options
- Improve UI/UX design
- Convert to React or another framework
- Use async/await for cleaner code
